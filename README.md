# Self-Learning - Convolutional-AutoEncoder-Implementation

1. Firstly a CNN architecture is trained for classification task on CIFAR
2. Then the an attempt has been made to improve the performance by training a Convolutional AutoEncoder and using the encoder part weights as initializtion for classification task
